The first thing I did when I started to learn OpenGL


The project uses Legacy OpenGL to render the graphics.

BUILD:
- To build the game you need to make a project with only the main file.
- Also you need to have the gl.h, glu.h, and glut.h header files in your include directory
- and to link glu and glut static libraries to the project.
